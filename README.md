## Project Overview
This project was created due to my love for cooking. My family has hundreds for secret recipes sent down from generations. Saving these recipes or as i like to call it "treasuring these recipes' is very important to me. This gave me the idea to create an app that will allow me to store these recipes all these fantastic recipes in one place so you can never lose them.

## Other Notes
The Secret key was initialy in the setting.py file. This was place here for testing purposes. However this has now been changed and placed into the evn.py which was placed in the git ignore. This prevents this sensitive information from being pushed up to github and viewed by others.
